0x01. Caching
Description
This project involves implementing various caching mechanisms in Python, building upon a base caching system. The caching mechanisms include simple caching, LRU caching, LFU caching, and others. Each caching mechanism is implemented as a class inheriting from a base class BaseCaching.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain how to implement different caching systems.
Understand the use and importance of caching in software applications.
Implement various caching algorithms like FIFO, LRU, and LFU.
Handle scenarios where cache items need to be evicted based on different policies.
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

base_caching.py: This module contains the BaseCaching class, which defines the basic structure and operations for a cache. All other caching classes inherit from this base class.
0-basic_cache.py: Implements a basic caching system with no limit.
Other Python files: Each file implements a different caching mechanism as specified in the project tasks.
Files
base_caching.py: Base class for caching systems.
0-basic_cache.py: Basic caching system implementation.
